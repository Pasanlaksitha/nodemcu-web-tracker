                    begin with, carelessness is one of the major causes of the road accidents all over the
                    world.
                    mobile phone while driving, breaking the traffic rules and entering from the wrong side driving
                    are some examples of carelessness.
                    Furthermore, inexperienced and untrained drivers and those with poor eyesight who drive at
                    night are one of the major causes of escalating accident rate.
                    addition, most of the people drive after drinking alcohol, which may lead to dangerous road
                    accident.

                provision of highways is resulting in convenience for the people. However, the main problem which is
                faced by the government of any country is the more frequent road accidents which are happening on
                the highways which results in severe damage in form of man power or infrastructure.
                The main reason behind the accidents which occur so frequently on the roads is the inattention which
                is given during driving a vehicle.
                There would probably be lesser amount of accidents if proper attention is paid and rules are
                followed during driving.

                    Accident due to Equipment Failure.
                    These could be of various types such as failing of break, bursting of tyre, tread separations or the
